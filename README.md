- 👋 Hi, I’m @iliyan-pigeon
- 👀 I’m interested in blockchain technologies, finance, machine learning and to an extend in cyber security, but this is a huge stretch, as I'm still developing my fundamentals in the field of programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python as my first programming language, as well as everything that comes around it, like Django, Flask, databases, a little Javascript and HTML/CSS ...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on every idea or proposal that is in my capabilities.
- 📫 How to reach me: e-mail: milenov556@gmail.com
